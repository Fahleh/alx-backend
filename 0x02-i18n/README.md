## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to:

## Requirements

### General

- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7).
- All your files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
- Your code should use the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5).
- All your `*.py` files should be executable.
- All your modules should have documentation (e.g., `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`).
- All your classes should have documentation (e.g., `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`).
- All your functions and methods should have documentation (e.g., `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`).
- Documentation should be a complete sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method (the length will be verified).
- All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
